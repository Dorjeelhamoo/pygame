# pygame
This is a Python script that uses the Pygame library to create a simple car racing game. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. `import pygame`: Imports the Pygame library, which provides functions for creating games and multimedia applications.

2. `from pygame.locals import *`: Imports various constants and functions from the `pygame.locals` module, which includes constants like `QUIT`, `KEYDOWN`, and others that are used later in the code.

3. `size = width, height = (400, 800)`: Sets the dimensions of the game window to be 400 pixels wide and 800 pixels tall.

4. `road_w = int(width/1.6)`: Calculates the width of the road as 1.6 times the width of the window.

5. `roadmark_w = int(width/80)`: Calculates the width of the road markings.

6. `right_lane = width/2 + road_w/4`: Sets the x-coordinate for the right lane, which is slightly to the right of the center of the window.

7. `left_lane = width/2 - road_w/4`: Sets the x-coordinate for the left lane, which is slightly to the left of the center of the window.

8. `speed = 1`: Initializes the speed variable for the cars in the game.

9. `pygame.init()`: Initializes the Pygame library.

10. `running = True`: Creates a boolean variable `running` to control the game loop.

11. `screen = pygame.display.set_mode(size)`: Creates the game window with the specified dimensions.

12. `pygame.display.set_caption('car game')`: Sets the caption of the game window to 'car game'.

13. `screen.fill((60, 220, 0))`: Fills the screen with a green color representing the grass.

14. `car = pygame.image.load('green-car.png')`: Loads an image of a green car.

15. `car_loc = car.get_rect()`: Creates a rectangle object to represent the location and size of the car.

16. `car_loc.center = right_lane, height*0.8`: Sets the initial position of the player's car to be in the right lane and lower part of the screen.

17. Similar steps are followed for loading and positioning the enemy car (`car2`) as well.

18. `counter = 0`: Initializes a counter variable.

19. Game Loop: The main loop of the game starts with `while running:`. This loop continues until `running` becomes False.

20. `counter += 1`: Increments the counter variable.

21. Level Up: If `counter` reaches 5000, the speed of the game increases by 0.15 units and the counter is reset to 0.

22. Enemy Movement: The enemy car (`car2`) is animated to move down the screen, and if it goes below the screen, it is repositioned either on the right or left lane randomly.
